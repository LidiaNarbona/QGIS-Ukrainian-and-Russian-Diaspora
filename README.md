# QGIS - Ukrainian and Russian Diaspora

This project analyzes the similarities, differences, and evolution of the Ukrainian and Russian diasporas, focusing on migration trends and the impact of recent geopolitical events such as the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The topic was chosen due to the global presence of Russian and Ukrainian migrants. In countries like Germany, Latvia, and Spain (with 110,977 Ukrainians and 82,024 Russians as of early 2022), these diasporas are very visible. The project focuses on diasporas in Europe and post-Soviet countries due to their historical and geographical ties.
